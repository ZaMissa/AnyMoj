# Refactoring Log

## Refactoring History

*Refactoring entries will be logged here as they occur during development*

## Template for Refactoring Entries

### REF-XXX: [Refactoring Title] (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Reason:** Why this refactoring was necessary
- **Changes:**
  - Detailed list of changes made
  - File moves, renames, restructures
  - API changes
- **Files Affected:**
  - src/path/to/file1.ts (renamed/modified/removed)
  - src/path/to/file2.ts (created/modified)
- **Impact:** How this affects other parts of the codebase
- **Breaking Changes:** Any breaking changes to consider
- **Testing Required:** What needs to be retested after refactoring
- **Status:** In Progress / Completed
- **Completion Date:** YYYY-MM-DD (when completed)

## Example Entry

### REF-001: Split IndexedDB Service into Store Modules (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Reason:** 
  - indexedDB.service.ts growing too large (800+ lines)
  - Hard to maintain and test as single file
  - Better separation of concerns needed
- **Changes:**
  - Created /src/services/stores/ folder
  - Split into machineStore.ts (machine CRUD operations)
  - Split into settingsStore.ts (settings operations)
  - Split into historyStore.ts (connection history operations)
  - Created dbConnection.ts (shared DB initialization)
  - Updated all imports across components
- **Files Affected:**
  - src/services/indexedDB.service.ts (removed)
  - src/services/stores/dbConnection.ts (created)
  - src/services/stores/machineStore.ts (created)
  - src/services/stores/settingsStore.ts (created)
  - src/services/stores/historyStore.ts (created)
  - src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (imports updated)
  - src/pages/MachineDetail.tsx (imports updated)
  - src/pages/Settings.tsx (imports updated)
  - src/hooks/useAutoBackup.ts (imports updated)
- **Impact:** 
  - All components using IndexedDB need import updates
  - Better code organization going forward
  - Easier to unit test individual stores
- **Breaking Changes:** 
  - Import paths changed from `services/indexedDB.service` to `services/stores/machineStore` etc.
- **Testing Required:** 
  - All CRUD operations for machines
  - Settings save/load
  - Connection history logging
  - Auto-backup functionality
- **Status:** Completed
- **Completion Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Common Refactoring Types

### Code Organization
- Splitting large files
- Moving components to better locations
- Creating utility functions
- Extracting repeated code

### Performance
- Implementing memoization
- Optimizing render cycles
- Code splitting
- Lazy loading

### Architecture
- Changing state management approach
- Restructuring data flow
- Updating service layer
- Modifying component hierarchy

### Dependencies
- Updating libraries
- Replacing dependencies
- Removing unused packages

## Guidelines for Refactoring

1. **Document Before:** Always create refactoring entry before starting
2. **Test After:** Thoroughly test affected functionality
3. **Update Imports:** Check all import statements
4. **Update Tests:** Modify any tests affected
5. **Commit Separately:** Refactoring should be in separate commits
6. **Reference in Commits:** Use REF-XXX in commit messages

---

## Notes
- Use sequential numbering (REF-001, REF-002, etc.)
- Document even small refactorings if they affect multiple files
- Link to related issues in BUGS-ISSUES.md if refactoring fixes bugs
- Keep entries concise but complete
- Update status as refactoring progresses
