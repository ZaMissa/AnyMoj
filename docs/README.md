   - Check BUGS-ISSUES.md for any blockers
   
2. **During Development:**
   - Update task status in TASKS.md (@in-progress)
   - Log bugs immediately in BUGS-ISSUES.md
   - Document technical decisions in DECISIONS.md
   
3. **End of Session:**
   - Update PROGRESS-TRACKER.md with summary
   - Mark completed tasks in TASKS.md and PROJECT-PLAN.md
   - Update bug statuses if resolved

### When to Update Each File

| PROGRESS-TRACKER.md | Daily | End of each work session |
| TASKS.md | Daily | When starting/completing tasks |
| BUGS-ISSUES.md | Immediately | When bugs found or resolved |
| TESTING-LOG.md | After testing | After each test session |
| DECISIONS.md | As needed | When making technical choices |
